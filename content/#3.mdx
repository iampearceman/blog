When taking a break from writing code, it gets harder to get back into the flow.

Something I've been trying to do is to write a blog post every day, actully sharing my journey of building in public.

An side project I had in mind for some time was to build a gaming platfrom for open source contributors.

I've started few times and every time I got distracted by other things. Now, when I'm back, I aim to ship the first version of it in 2 days time.

One of the tasks I'm facing right now is set up the database. I'm uisng Prisma with Supabase (Postgres).

I think for the time being, it should be enough.

I will be uisng Clerk for authentication.

I will try use only tailwind for styling to keep it simple, and minimize the number of dependencies in this project.

For every project, I belive that it comes to currect scoping of the project, or to be even more precise, to the currect scope of the phase of the project.

Here is the scopee of the POC:

- Anyone can create an account and login
- There will be a home / landing page with a short description of the platform
- Side navogation with links to the leaderboard, dashboard and settings
- Each user starts with 0 expireace points and 0 reputation
- The platfrom will have a leaderboard of all users (Ranked by their level)
- There will be a user personal dashboard with their stats
- There will be at least one configured repository

Stay tuned for the next update!
