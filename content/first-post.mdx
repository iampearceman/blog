# Welcome to my blog!

This is my first post written in MDX. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you.

## Some features:

- **Markdown support** - Write content in familiar Markdown syntax
- **Code highlighting** - Share code snippets with syntax highlighting
- **Custom components** - Embed React components directly in your posts

### Example Code Block

```typescript
function greet(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}
```

### Custom Component Example

You can import and use custom React components directly in your MDX:

<InfoBox>
  This is a custom component rendered inside MDX!
</InfoBox>

Stay tuned for more posts coming soon!
